  <h1><center>Background Checks</center></h1>
  <h2>Description: <br>
    <p id="text">A background check is a procedure used to determine whether or not an individual is eligible to buy a firearm
      <span id="dots">...</span>
      <span id="more"><br> <br> • Under current law, if a person who is not a federally licensed gun dealer wants to purchase a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer, they must first complete a background check.
        <br> • A federally licensed gun dealer is a person who buys and sells firearms repeatedly for profit and as a principal source of their livelihood.
        <br> •  People who occasionally buy and sell firearms are not required to be licensed federally as a gun dealer. Unlicensed persons, however, are only allowed to buy and sell firearms in the state where they live.
        <br> •  Current federal law does not require background checks for firearms transactions between two unlicensed persons over the age of 18 who live in the same state.
        <br> • Background checks are conducted either electronically or over the phone using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
        <br> • Once the potential buyer provides their name, sex, race, date of birth, and state of residence, the system will provide one of four responses: proceed, denied, delayed proceed, or cancelled.
        <br> • Since it was launched in November of 1998, the NCIS system has processed over 300 million background checks and denied over 1.5 million firearm purchases.
        <br> • Online background checks take 107 seconds, on average.
        <br> • There are ten categories of people who are ineligible to receive firearms.
        <br> These categories include fugitives, unlawful drug users, mental defectives, unauthorized immigrants, juveniles, and others. The main source of these eligibility criteria is the Gun Control Act of 1968.3

          <span id="more2"><br><br>On August 8, 2019, President Trump told reporters, "Frankly, we need intelligent background checks," He added, "On background checks, we have tremendous support for really common sense, sensible, important background checks."
                                  According to the polls, there are few issues with as broad support as universal background checks — 89% overall said they supported background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales, in a July NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Even 84% of Republicans are in favor of them, according to the poll.
                                  According to a poll done in January 2013 by Johns Hopkins University, 84% of gun-owners and 74% of NRA members (vs. 90% of non–gun-owners) supported requiring a universal background-check system for all gun sales
                                  A CBS News/New York Times poll, also from January 2013, found that background checks on all potential gun buyers were favored by 85 percent of NRA households. And a February 2013 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 74 percent of people in NRA households favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.

          <span id="more3"><br><br>People who occasionally buy and sell firearms are not required to be licensed federally as a gun dealer.  Current federal law does not require background checks for firearms transactions between two unlicensed persons over the age of 18 who live in the same state. A study found that such purchases account for 22% of gun sales. Additionally, a survey of prisoners convicted of gun offenses revealed that Nearly all (96.1%) offenders who were legally prohibited from purchasing a gun acquired their gun from a supplier not required to conduct a background check.

          <span id="dots4">...</span>
          <span id="more4"><br><br>Since the federal background check requirement was adopted in 1994, over 3 million people legally prohibited from possessing a gun have been stopped from purchasing a gun or denied a permit to purchase. More than 35% of these denials involved people convicted of felony offenses.
