  <h2>Description: <br>
    <p id="bulletPoints">A background check is a procedure used to determine whether or not an individual is eligible to buy a firearm
      <span id="more"><br> <br> • Under current law, if a person who is not a federally licensed gun dealer wants to purchase a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer, they must first complete a background check.
        <br> • A federally licensed gun dealer is a person who buys and sells firearms repeatedly for profit and as a principal source of their livelihood.
        <br> • People who occasionally buy and sell firearms are not required to be licensed federally as a gun dealer. Unlicensed persons, however, are only allowed to buy and sell firearms in the state where they live.
        <br> • Current federal law does not require background checks for firearms transactions between two unlicensed persons over the age of 18 who live in the same state.
        <br> • Background checks are conducted either electronically or over the phone using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
        <br> • Once the potential buyer provides their name, sex, race, date of birth, and state of residence, the system will provide one of four responses: proceed, denied, delayed proceed, or cancelled.
        <br> • Since it was launched in November of 1998, the NCIS system has processed over 300 million background checks and denied over 1.5 million firearm purchases.
        <br> • Online background checks take 107 seconds, on average.
        <br> • There are ten categories of people who are ineligible to receive firearms.
        <br>    • These categories include fugitives, unlawful drug users, mental defectives, unauthorized immigrants, juveniles, and others. The main source of these eligibility criteria is the Gun Control Act of 1968.3

          <span id="more2"><br><br>On August 8, 2019, President Trump told reporters, "Frankly, we need intelligent background checks," He added, "On background checks, we have tremendous support for really common sense, sensible, important background checks."
                                  According to the polls, there are few issues with as broad support as universal background checks — 89% overall said they supported background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales, in a July NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Even 84% of Republicans are in favor of them, according to the poll.
                                  According to a poll done in January 2013 by Johns Hopkins University, 84% of gun-owners and 74% of NRA members (vs. 90% of non–gun-owners) supported requiring a universal background-check system for all gun sales
                                  A CBS News/New York Times poll, also from January 2013, found that background checks on all potential gun buyers were favored by 85 percent of NRA households. And a February 2013 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 74 percent of people in NRA households favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.

        <p id="bulletPoints">Current laws have dangerous loopholes
          <span id="more3"><br><br>People who occasionally buy and sell firearms are not required to be licensed federally as a gun dealer.  Current federal law does not require background checks for firearms transactions between two unlicensed persons over the age of 18 who live in the same state. A study found that such purchases account for 22% of gun sales. Additionally, a survey of prisoners convicted of gun offenses revealed that Nearly all (96.1%) offenders who were legally prohibited from purchasing a gun acquired their gun from a supplier not required to conduct a background check.

          <span id="more4"><br><br>Since the federal background check requirement was adopted in 1994, over 3 million people legally prohibited from possessing a gun have been stopped from purchasing a gun or denied a permit to purchase. More than 35% of these denials involved people convicted of felony offenses.

        <p id="bulletPoints">Background checks should not be expanded
        <span id="more5"><br><br>Groups such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) oppose the expansion of background checks.
                             <br>Main arguments
                             <br>Existing law is sufficient -

        <span id="more6"><br><br>A 2016 Department of Justice survey of prisoners who possessed a firearm during the offense for which they were serving found that only 7% of them had purchased their firearm under their own name from a licensed seller. More than half (56%) had either stolen it (6%), found it at the scene of the crime (7%), or obtained it off the street or from the underground market (43%). Most of the remainder (25%) had obtained it from a family member or friend, or as a gift.
	                               People prohibited from buying guns can also get around background checks by having someone who can pass a background check purchase it for them (this practice is illegal and known as “straw purchasing”).

</div>
<h2>Description: <br>
  <p id="bulletPoints">An assault weapons ban is a law that prohibits the civilian possession, manufacture, or transfer of assault weapons.
    <span id="more8"><br> <br> • In 1994, Congress passed the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, which included an assault weapons ban.
      <br> • This act expired in 2004, and no other federal ban has taken its place.
      <br> • There is no universally accepted, technical definition of assault weapons. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and the ban proposed by Senator Diane Fienstein in 2019 both emphasize that assault weapons are semi-automatic, capable of accepting detachable magazines, and can include certain rifles, shotguns, and pistols.
      <br> • Although there is no federal assault weapon ban, a few states such as California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, District of Columbia, and Washington have passed their own assault weapon bans.
      <br> • An ammunition cap is a law that prohibits the civilian possession, manufacture, or transfer of large capacity magazines.
      <br> • A large capacity magazine is an ammunition feeding device that is capable of holding, or could be easily modified to hold, more than ten rounds of ammunition.
      <br> • In addition to its assault weapon ban, the 1994 Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act included an ammunition cap.
      <br> • In the time since the act expired in 2004, no new ammunition cap has passed through Congress.

<h2>Description: <br>
  <p id="bulletPoints">Allows family members or law enforcement to request that a judge temporarily prohibit a particular person from owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm.
    <span id="more15"><br> <br> • In 1994, Congress passed the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, which included an assault weapons ban.
      <br> • Red flag laws exist in 17 states and the District of Columbia but do not exist at the federal level.
      <br> • Family members are defined as those related to the subject of the request by blood, marriage, or adoption, but can also include domestic partners, legal guardians, cohabitors, dating partners, and others depending on the particular law.
      <br> • The written form produced by the judge authorizing the prohibition is known as an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO).
      <br> • In order to successfully petition for an ERPO, the petitioner must prove to the judge that the person poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to themself or others as a result of owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm.
      <br> • The judge’s determination is usually based on the standard of preponderance, which means that if the judge finds it to be more likely than not that the person poses such a danger, an ERPO will be issued.
      <br> • Warning signs considered by the judge may include behaviors such as self-harm, acts and threats of violence, violent mental health issues, or substance abuse.
      <br> • In the event that a person is believed to pose significant danger to themselves in the extremely near future, some laws allow an ERPO to be issued under the less rigorous evidence standard of reasonable cause, which requires sufficient facts to exist that a reasonably intelligent person would find that the person posed a significant danger.
      <br> • These expedited ERPOs are often known as ex parte ERPOs.
      <br> • Although all ERPOs are temporary, they can be renewed.

</div>
<h2>Description: <br>
  <p id="bulletPoints">The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) was enacted in 2005 to protect manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition from being held liable for crimes committed with their products.
    <span id="more23"><br><br> • It passed through the Senate 65/31 with 49 Republican cosponsors and 12 Democratic cosponsors. It passed through the House 283/144.
                           <br> • The PLCAA does not protect the parties from being held liable for damages resulting from actions they are directly responsible for such as defective products, breach of contract, and criminal misconduct.
                           <br> • As a result of the PLCAA, a qualified civil liability action may not be brought against these parties in any state or federal court.
                           <br> • The PLCAA also dismissed all civil liability actions that were pending on the date it was enacted.
                           <br> • A qualified civil liability action is defined in the PLCAA as an action or proceeding brought against one of the specified parties for damages or other relief, resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by a third party.
                           <br> • In addition to the legal immunity it gave, the PLCAA also mandated child safety locks on handguns, provided immunity from civil liability to lawful handgun owners who use secure gun storage or safety devices for damages resulting from unauthorized use, and restricted the manufacture of armor-piercing ammunition.

      <p id="bulletPoints">The Act’s exceptions are sufficient to still hold companies accountable
        <span id="more24"><br><br> • The PLCAA includes six exceptions.
                              <br> 1 • a civil action or proceeding or an administrative proceeding brought by any person against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product, or a trade association, for damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, or penalties, or other relief, resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person or a third party
                              <br> 2 • an action brought against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per se
                              <br> - `negligent entrustment' means the supplying of a qualified product by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or reasonably should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or others
                              <br> 3 • an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought
                              <br> 4 • an action for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of the product
                              <br> 5 • an action for death, physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner
                              <br> 6 • an action or proceeding commenced by the Attorney General to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18 or chapter 53 of title 26, United States Code.

      <p id="bulletPoints">Lawsuits against gun companies failed even before the PLCAA
        <span id="more25"><br><br> • In the book Suing the Gun Industry, Wendy Wagner of Texas Law wrote that "gun litigation has been an utter failure" — the gun industry had been able to mount a successful legal defense against the lawsuits, usually getting the litigation dismissed before it went to trial. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/14/9533389/bernie-sanders-gun-lawsuits-democratic-debate">vox.com/2015/10/14/9533389/bernie-sanders-gun-lawsuits-democratic-debate</a>

      <p id="bulletPoints">The PLCAA was passed with broad bipartisan support
        <span id="more26"><br><br> • The PLCAA passed through the Senate 65-31, with 14 Democratic senators voting for it. It passed through the House 283-144, with 59 Democratic representatives voting for it.  <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s397">govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s397</a>

      <p id="bulletPoints">Such lawsuits are not fair to the gun industry, politically motivated, and costly
        <span id="more27"><br><br> • These suits are intended to drive gunmakers out of business by holding manufacturers and dealers liable for the criminal acts of third parties who are totally beyond their control. Suing the firearms industry for street crime is like suing General Motors for criminal acts involving Buicks. <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20100401/protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms">nraila.org/articles/20100401/protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms</a>
                              <br> • While the suits are unwarranted, the firearms industry has had to spend over $200 million in defense. <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20100401/protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms">nraila.org/articles/20100401/protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms</a>
                              <br> • "History will show that this law helped save the American firearms industry from collapse under the burden of these ruinous and politically motivated lawsuits," said Wayne LaPierre, NRA’s executive vice president at the time of the bill’s passage. <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20051026/president-bush-signs-protection-of-br">nraila.org/articles/20051026/president-bush-signs-protection-of-br</a>

    <p id="bulletPoints">Removes accountability
      <span id="more28"><br><br> • Civil liability plays an important role in injury prevention. Dangerous products and careless industry practices are normally held in check by the possibility of civil litigation that enables injured individuals to recover monetarily. <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/other-laws-policies/gun-industry-immunity/">lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/other-laws-policies/gun-industry-immunity/</a>

    <p id="bulletPoints">Accountability used to be effective in increasing safety
      <span id="more29"><br><br> • In 2000, Smith & Wesson agreed to adopt additional safety practices, such as selling safety devices with each handgun; establishing a code of conduct for authorized dealers and distributors; and including a hidden set of serial numbers on the inside of all new guns in order to make it more difficult for criminals to scratch off these identifying markings. The company did this as part of a settlement agreement that ended several lawsuits. <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2016/01/15/128949/immunizing-the-gun-industry-the-harmful-effect-of-the-protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms-act/">americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2016/01/15/128949/immunizing-the-gun-industry-the-harmful-effect-of-the-protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms-act/</a>
        <br> • In 2002, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo went on a nine-month crime spree that left 17 people dead and seven injured, including 10 individuals killed in what is now infamously known as the Beltway sniper shootings. After federal agents traced the guns used in the attacks back to Bull’s Eye Shooter Supply, they discovered that the retailer failed to keep required records of the gun sales and had lost more than 238 guns over the previous three years—guns that were supposed to be in their inventory. Victims’ families sued the snipers, Bull’s Eye, as well as the gun manufacturer, Bushmaster, arguing that the store was responsible for the shootings because of its negligent sales practices and that Bushmaster was responsible because it continued to supply firearms to the store despite the store’s known negligence. In 2004, both the dealer and manufacturer were held liable in a $2.5 million settlement. In addition to monetary damages paid by both parties, Bushmaster agreed to change its distribution practices. <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2016/01/15/128949/immunizing-the-gun-industry-the-harmful-effect-of-the-protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms-act/">americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2016/01/15/128949/immunizing-the-gun-industry-the-harmful-effect-of-the-protection-of-lawful-commerce-in-arms-act/</a>
