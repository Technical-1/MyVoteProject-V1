# myvoteproject.com/

I was asked by my friend to be a part of this project and write their first website while they were trying to start their company.

MyVoteProject (MVP) is a national, nonpartisan organization revolutionizing the way people vote and think about politics. They curate information on candidates in an easy-to-understand format and present policy issues that are critical to voters. They empower people to elect candidates who will best represent their constituents at all levels of government from school board member to president!

This was the first time I wrote a full site from scratch and ended up having to scrap all of the code when they partenered with a independent contractor. I stayed with the project for a year after, working with the code advisor and the contractor. The current site is the result from that work and further development.

# Information
All information included on this intial version was provided by David, Gita, and Sari. (my bosses at the time/founders of the project)
I am not affiliated or responsible for any of the text included. I simply copy and pasted the research they provided me and created all other details of the site to their very specific specifications.
