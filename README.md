# Technical-1.github.io

I was asked by my friend Sari Kaufman to be a part of this project. 
This was the first time I wrote a full site with everything from the javascript to the css from scratch.
I wrote the code from the ground up using online resources for insight on how to do things that I don't know yet.
It was a very fun process and I'm excited to continue to push updates and make it better over time.

# Hosting
The site is hosting using github pages and uses a custom domain through squarespace

# Information
All information included was provided by David, Gita, and Sari
